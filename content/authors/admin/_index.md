I am a chemistry and research teacher at Philippine Science High School Southern Mindanao Campus. As STEM teacher, I work to improve outcomes for student education in science through the development of instructional materials, methods and curricula, mentoring of students/teachers, and implementation of research.

My undergraduate work in chemistry and graduate work in applied mathematics allow me to fill the niche of experimental design and analysis. A large aspect of my educational work involves improving outcomes of high school students in STEM research. I founded [Tanim Talino](http://tanimtalino.org) to bridge the gap in Filipino student preparedness for research, specifically as a response to the remote learning circumstances during the pandemic.

Despite these professional pursuits, my primary interests are in the studies and implementation of science education, with a focus on how science education was, and could be, crafted. A common theme in my research interests is the student, particularly on how she navigates ideas about herself, society, and actual STEM work, as a result of her STEM education.
