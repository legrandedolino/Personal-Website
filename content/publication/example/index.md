abstract: "Bromelain, a valuable protease present in all parts of the pineapple
  fruit, was previously shown to be separated from pineapple juice and protected
  by complexation with polyphenols. This study aimed to establish a simple,
  low-cost procedure for the collection of solids with bromelain using
  industrial pineapple waste and polyphenols extracted from cashew leaf. An
  alternative method was introduced that allows for solids that have higher
  protease activities from pineapple core and pulp to be obtained from pineapple
  extract compared to typical extraction and purification methods. Using this
  modified method, solids were obtained from pineapple waste with the following
  protease activities: 5343 CDU/g (core), 5147 CDU/g (peel), and 5732 CDU/g
  (pulp). Given the simplicity and low cost of the procedure, this method can be
  of benefit to smaller pineapple producers who could profit from obtaining an
  otherwise expensive material using their productionâ€™s waste."
