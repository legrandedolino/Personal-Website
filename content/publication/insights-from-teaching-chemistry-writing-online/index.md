abstract: This communication recounts two learning-to-write (LTW) activities in
  a grade 10 chemistry elective course that were implemented online due to the
  COVID-19 pandemic. The activities sought to develop chemistry writing skill
  for use in studentsâ€™ STEM research. Students seemed to display difficulty in
  applying topics discussed in class despite them having continued access to the
  materials. The author reflects in this paper how teachers, to enforce learning
  of chemistry writing, should avoid viewing writing as a product but as a
  process, similar to actual writing teachers. This communication might be
  useful for teachers that require laboratory reports or other written work
  during distance learning.
