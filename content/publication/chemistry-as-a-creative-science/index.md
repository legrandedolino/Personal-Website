abstract: How do we teach chemistry as a different science from physics? This
  paper looks into a fundamental distinguishing property of chemistry as a
  science. It is characterized in this paper that chemistry, unlike many other
  sciences that are largely descriptive, is primarily creative. In this sense,
  the various fields of chemistry may seek to create as an end goal, and not
  merely to create as a means to an end as commonly seen in allied sciences.
  This distinction is important as it elevates the importance of chemical
  synthesis above being a small detail of the field. I argue in this paper that
  synthesis is a largely defining character of chemistry as a structured
  science, and must be given importance to when attempting to define chemistry
  as a separate study from similar fields. Awareness of the importance of
  synthesis can elucidate on the manner and trends of normal chemical research
  as well as predict possible circumstances that will arise for the field of
  chemistry.
